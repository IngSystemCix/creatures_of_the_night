Each musical track folder contains 3 tracks, a FULL track, an INTRO track and a LOOP track. Although the INTRO and LOOP tracks 
can sound identical, the INTRO track should be played first and then played seamlessly into the LOOP track. 
The LOOP track is the track that will be told to loop in the game engine or middleware such as FMOD or Wwise.
The FULL track is included just in case you would like it or want to use it to create your own loops.
